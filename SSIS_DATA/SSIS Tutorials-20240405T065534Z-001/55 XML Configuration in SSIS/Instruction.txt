1. Copy the downloaded Zip file to a new drive, and then UnZip it there. I am unzipping it to D drive.
2. To configure the SSIS package. Open the Solution in Visual Studio 2013 or in SQL Server Data Tools 2013.
3. Right Click "(local).Testing" OLE DB Connection Manager, Select Edit. Provide (local) under Server Name and enter a valid database name from your sql server.
4. Right Click in Control Flow and select Variables. Under "FilePath" SSIS variable, set the value to a valid path where you want to import data from. I have set it to "D:\Executing Package from command line\File\TestData_1.CSV"
5. To set the path of XML Configuration file, Right Click on SSIS package "LoadCSVFile.dtsx" and select "View Code". You will see some XML code there.
6. Search the text "ConfigurationString", next to it there will be older path of XML configuration file, change it to correct\valid path of XML configuration file at your system. I am setting it to "D:\XML Configuration in SSIS\SSIS Package\Executing Package from batch file\MyConfigFile.dtsConfig". Save and close the "LoadCSVFile.dtsx" SSIS package.
7. Navigate to "D:\XML Configuration in SSIS\SSIS Package\Executing Package from batch file" location and open the "MyConfigFile.dtsConfig" XML Configuration file in notepad\notepad++ and under "ConfiguredValue" set the path to D:\XML Configuration in SSIS\File\TestData_2.CSV.
8. Now you should be good to execute the SSIS package. Hit F5 to execute the SSIS package. 
9. The SSIS package will create "TestData"\"tblLogs" SQL tables in the configured database in step 3 and then it will read the value of "FilePath" SSIS variable from XML Configuration file and and currently as it is set to "TestData_2.csv" so it will fetch data from "TestData_2.CSV" file and will import it to "TestData" SQL table.
