--Problem Statement :-   ABC Bank is trying to find their customers transaction mode. 
--Customers are using different apps such as Gpay, PhonePe, Paytm etc along with offline transactions. 
--Bank wants to know which mode/app is used for highest amount of transactions in each location.
--Write a SQL query to find the app/mode and the count for highest amount of transactions in each location

--Consider below points while fetching the record :-
--* Columns to be fetched – App, Count
--* Count – Number of times the app is used for the highest amount of transaction for each location. 
--* If the App column is NULL, it means the customer has paid the amount through Offline  mode        
--* The first letter of the app name should be in uppercase letter and the rest followed by the lowercase
--* The Count should be in descending order
