--Problem Statement : Calls Table has three columns namely From_Id, To_Id and Duration . 
--It contains duration of calls between From_Id and To_Id. Write a SQL query to report the number 
--of calls and the total call duration between each pair of distinct persons (Person1,Person2) where 
--Person1 is less than Person2. Return the result as shown in Output Table.

From_Id int,
To_Id int,
Duration int   
)
INSERT INTO Calls Values(1,2,59);
INSERT INTO Calls Values(2,1,11);
INSERT INTO Calls Values(1,3,20);
INSERT INTO Calls Values(3,4,100);
INSERT INTO Calls Values(3,4,200);
INSERT INTO Calls Values(3,4,200);
INSERT INTO Calls Values(4,3,499);

SELECT 
CASE WHEN From_Id < To_Id THEN From_Id ELSE To_Id END AS PERSON1,

)
SELECT PERSON1,PERSON2,COUNT(Duration) AS 'Call_count',
SUM(Duration) AS 'Total_duration'
