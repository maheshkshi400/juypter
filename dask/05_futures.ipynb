    "Submit arbitrary functions for computation in a parallelized, eager, and non-blocking way. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `futures` interface (derived from the built-in `concurrent.futures`) provide fine-grained real-time execution for custom situations. We can submit individual functions for evaluation with one set of inputs, or evaluated over a sequence of inputs with `submit()` and `map()`. The call returns immediately, giving one or more *futures*, whose status begins as \"pending\" and later becomes \"finished\". There is no blocking of the local Python session.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the important difference between futures and delayed. Both can be used to support arbitrary task scheduling, but delayed is lazy (it just constructs a graph) whereas futures are eager. With futures, as soon as the inputs are available and there is compute available, the computation starts. \n",
